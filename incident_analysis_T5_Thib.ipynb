      "Input: Could you elaborate on the unexpected event described in the incident report? Context:  At around 10:00 p.m. on November 10  2013  Employee #1  with Villager  Construction Inc.  with a coworker  were using an asphalt milling machine  (Wirtgen; Model Number: W2100) to grind out existing asphalt from an  interstate at a railroad bridge overpass. Employee # 1 was standing on the  ground  checking the depth of the cut into the asphalt  using a handheld  pendant attached to the machine. The pedant could stretch out from ten to 15  ft. This allowed Employee #1 to walk back and forth  checking the cut. The  operator was on the top of the milling machine  controlling the operation of  the machine and ensuring that the milling machine and dump truck (driven by a  second coworker  who worked for an independent trucking service) kept a safe  working distance. A different company  Protective Services Inc. (PSI)  was  responsible for the traffic control of the job site and had shut down the  inside lane of a three lane section of the interstate  so that work could be  conducted on that lane. The entire work zone was approximately two miles long   from start to finish. Employee #1 and the operator of the milling machine had  completed milling four sections (eight total passes) of the inside lane at the  bridge overpasses and were waiting for PSI to shut down the center lane. Dual  lane shut down of the inside and center lanes of the interstate was completed  around 9:30 p.m.  and Employee #1 and the milling machine operator milled two  sections (four total passes) of the center lane. Once both sides of the  overpass were milled out  approximately 200 ft on each side  Employee #1 and  the operator of the milling machine moved the milling machine down the  interstate  approximately1 000 ft  to a railroad overpass and began setting up  to mill the center lane sections. The truck driver backed his truck into  position and remained in the truck to move the truck slowly forward as milling  took place. Employee #1 was positioned between the milling machine and the  concrete median dividers  inside the coned off work zone. The lanes of travel  were approximately 12 ft wide  so the milling machine made two passes  since  it can only cut seven ft wide on each section to cover the entire lane.  Employee #1 was standing approximately three ft in the far inside lane on the  ground between milling machine and interior median wall inside of the approved  traffic control set up  and approximately midway up the machine and 17 ft from  the traffic control devices and flow of traffic. The milling machine was  approximately nine ft wide by 50 ft long  while operating. Employee #1 was  guarded by the machine from the flow of traffic. Approximately five to ten  minutes into the first pass  the milling machine operator noticed lights  hitting the reflectors on the inside wall and turned briefly to see a vehicle  coming. The operator thought it was the Project manager coming to check on the  status of the project. Then  the operator realized that the oncoming vehicle  was not equipped with a strobe  as required in work zones. The operator turned  and yelled for Employee # 1 to run for safety  as a Chevrolet Tahoe came down  the inside lane where Employee #1 was standing. The driver of the Tahoe  continued traveling in the far inside lane of the work zone  where Employee #1  was struck and thrown some 100 ft from where he was originally standing. The  vehicle was moving approximately 45 mph per hour. As he was transferred to a  hospital by emergency personnel  Employee #1 was treated for severe trauma   lacerations  fractures  and contusions to the body and head. Employee #1 was  pronounced dead at the hospital. The driver of the vehicle disregarded the  traffic control set up  all warning lights on the rear of the milling machine   and cone spacing of 100 ft. The construction work zone was set up correctly  with all signage  cone spacing  tapering  attenuators  and lighting; all of  the traffic control set up was approved by MUTCD for this type of tr  <extra_id_0>\n",

      "Input: Please provide the exact date and time when the incident took place. Context:  At around 10:00 p.m. on November 10  2013  Employee #1  with Villager  Construction Inc.  with a coworker  were using an asphalt milling machine  (Wirtgen; Model Number: W2100) to grind out existing asphalt from an  interstate at a railroad bridge overpass. Employee # 1 was standing on the  ground  checking the depth of the cut into the asphalt  using a handheld  pendant attached to the machine. The pedant could stretch out from ten to 15  ft. This allowed Employee #1 to walk back and forth  checking the cut. The  operator was on the top of the milling machine  controlling the operation of  the machine and ensuring that the milling machine and dump truck (driven by a  second coworker  who worked for an independent trucking service) kept a safe  working distance. A different company  Protective Services Inc. (PSI)  was  responsible for the traffic control of the job site and had shut down the  inside lane of a three lane section of the interstate  so that work could be  conducted on that lane. The entire work zone was approximately two miles long   from start to finish. Employee #1 and the operator of the milling machine had  completed milling four sections (eight total passes) of the inside lane at the  bridge overpasses and were waiting for PSI to shut down the center lane. Dual  lane shut down of the inside and center lanes of the interstate was completed  around 9:30 p.m.  and Employee #1 and the milling machine operator milled two  sections (four total passes) of the center lane. Once both sides of the  overpass were milled out  approximately 200 ft on each side  Employee #1 and  the operator of the milling machine moved the milling machine down the  interstate  approximately1 000 ft  to a railroad overpass and began setting up  to mill the center lane sections. The truck driver backed his truck into  position and remained in the truck to move the truck slowly forward as milling  took place. Employee #1 was positioned between the milling machine and the  concrete median dividers  inside the coned off work zone. The lanes of travel  were approximately 12 ft wide  so the milling machine made two passes  since  it can only cut seven ft wide on each section to cover the entire lane.  Employee #1 was standing approximately three ft in the far inside lane on the  ground between milling machine and interior median wall inside of the approved  traffic control set up  and approximately midway up the machine and 17 ft from  the traffic control devices and flow of traffic. The milling machine was  approximately nine ft wide by 50 ft long  while operating. Employee #1 was  guarded by the machine from the flow of traffic. Approximately five to ten  minutes into the first pass  the milling machine operator noticed lights  hitting the reflectors on the inside wall and turned briefly to see a vehicle  coming. The operator thought it was the Project manager coming to check on the  status of the project. Then  the operator realized that the oncoming vehicle  was not equipped with a strobe  as required in work zones.

They scraped the interiors of the  building and collected debris as they finished up the job. On August 28  2012   at approximately 10:00 a.m  the job assignment was done and every employee was  to put away all the rubble and gather all equipment in order to pack up and  leave the site.

      "Input: What were the underlying reasons and causes that led to the incident? Context:  On August 27  2012  Employee #1  a 19 year-old male laborer with Stomper  Company Inc.  arrived at 2:00 .am. at a site in Menlo Park California to  demolish the interiors of the building. They scraped the interiors of the  building and collected debris as they finished up the job. On August 28  2012   at approximately 10:00 a.m  the job assignment was done and every employee was  to put away all the rubble and gather all equipment in order to pack up and  leave the site. When the job assignment was finished  it is typical for all  employees to gather everything and put it away into the garbage bin or in  their trailers and bins. At the time  four coworkers were outside in the  parking lot working near the Number 5 700 Panther. Two coworkers were going to  load the number 5 700 Panther and Employee #1 stated that he was going to load  the number 5 700 Panther on a trailer when their trailer returns from the trip  delivering their first load. This worker got on a Gradall machine to lift a  box bin and move it towards the number 5 700 Panther. The coworkers stated  that Employee #1  not the employee designated to drive the Panther  got on  this vehicle and started driving it. Employee #1 attempted to load a number  5 700 Panther on to a bin. This bin had a rubber lip with a four to five inch  incline ramp on its lip's edge. Employee #1 drove the Panther straight  backwards on the bin and did not go through this four to five inch ramp bump  on to the bin. Right after this unsuccessful attempt  Employee #1 drove it  backwards a second time except this time slightly slanted to his left side.  The left wheel touched the ramp first. On this second attempt  the number  5 700 Panther fell and flipped over. Employee #1 attempted to jump out of this  vehicle but was unable to get away as the Panther which weighed over 2 000  pounds fell on his left foot and pinned it. A coworker got the Gradall  machinery in order to remove the Panther that was on top of Employee #1's left  foot. Employee #1 suffered a serious fracture injury to his left leg and was  hospitalized over twenty-four hours. Employee #1 also stated that he is well  trained in driving other construction vehicle equipment by another foreman.      <extra_id_0>\n",

Context:  At approximately 9:00 a.m. on February 6  2009  Employee #1 was a service  technician for Arbon Equipment. He was at Birds Eye Foods to service the dock  lock on Bay Number 3. He parked his service truck in front of Bay Number 3. A  tractor-trailer unit was parked in the adjacent bay and there was a gap of  approximately 2 to 3 ft between the trailer and the loading dock frame.  Employee #1 went to the front of the truck to look for the driver. He did not  see the driver so he walked to the back of the trailer and climbed on top of  the dock lock to examine it. The truck driver had been in the sleeper berth. A  dock worker notified the truck driver that he was not fully backed into place  at the loading dock. The driver backed up to close the gap  unaware that  Employee #1 was on the dock lock. Employee #1 fell off the dock lock and was  pinned between the loading dock and trailer. He suffered a fractured pelvis  a  ruptured bladder  and leg vein damage. He was hospitalized for treatment of  his injuries.                                                                    <extra_id_0>\n",

Context:  At approximately 3:00 p.m. on June 17  2010  Employee #1  a plumber  and the  company general manager were laying approximately 475 ft of 4 in. PVC lateral  sewer line from a new residential dwelling to a municipal tie-in point. The  general manager was operating a Bobcat excavator  Model Number 331E   Identification Number 232711536  while Employee #1 occupied the 4 ft to 7 ft  deep trench checking the fall angle of the lateral and connecting gasket  joints with grease. Approximately 200 ft into the work  Employee #1 was  working in a 7 ft deep part of the trench near a solid wall 2.5 ft wide by 5  ft deep by 33 ft long when it sheared and collapsed. Employee #1 was killed.  Upon further investigation  it was learned that nine days prior to this event   the local electric municipal dug and backfilled an underground line from a  transformer to the residential dwelling with a trenching machine that made 4  in. to 6 in. wide cuts at a 4 ft to 5 ft depth. The trench wall ran adjacent  to the previously trenched electrical line by 2.5 ft. Due to the prior trench  work  there was inadequate sloping and backfill and an engineered tension  crack which increased the angle of internal friction and shear strength of the  wall.                                                                            <extra_id_0>\n",

Context:  At approximately 3:45 PM on April 18  2007  Employee #1 had accessed a hopper  barge to release a cable that had been used to support the barge on the  starboard side. The barge  a Flexifloat  is a modular system consisting of two  10 ft by 40 ft sections side by side with another 10 ft by 20 ft section  attached at the end. The total size was 20 ft by 50 ft. The hopper section  consisted of 1-in. plate steel. The plates were welded vertically to the deck  and the side plates were welded at an angle with steel I beams for support to  deflect material to the center. The plates were approximately 8 ft high. The  barge was used to catch construction debris from a bridge that was being  demolished. After Employee #1 released the cable  a coworker who was operating  a tug boat  put the boat at notch one in reverse to back the barge out from  under the bridge. After moving approximately 2 ft the barge listed to  starboard approximately 6 to12 inches. It then rolled back to port the same  distance  then back to even keel. It then rolled back to port and capsized  both vessels. As the vessels were rolling to the port side  Employee #1 jumped  into the water and started to swim away.

They were inside a 6 000 square foot  containment with 14 foot ceilings  using a propane-powered floor scraper to  remove the two layers of flooring and most of the mastic from the concrete  subfloor. One employee was driving the scraper while others sprayed a wetting  agent and shoveled the flooring into bags. After using the floor-scraping  machine for approximately 3 hours  the employees began to experience nausea  and dizziness. Emergency Services was called and all ten workers were  transported to the hospital for evaluation and treatment. Their highest  blood-gas readings were in the low 20s  but none suffered permanent injury.  Two 2 000-cubic-foot-per-minute negative air machines were being used to  evacuate air from the containment. The floor scraper was a Terminator 2   manufactured by the Innovatech Products and Equipment Company. It was designed  to emit 40 parts per million of carbon monoxide at the tailpipe  but testing  during the inspection showed that it was emitting 10 000 parts per million.

They were inside a 6 000 square foot  containment with 14 foot ceilings  using a propane-powered floor scraper to  remove the two layers of flooring and most of the mastic from the concrete  subfloor. One employee was driving the scraper while others sprayed a wetting  agent and shoveled the flooring into bags. After using the floor-scraping  machine for approximately 3 hours  the employees began to experience nausea  and dizziness. Emergency Services was called and all ten workers were  transported to the hospital for evaluation and treatment. Their highest  blood-gas readings were in the low 20s  but none suffered permanent injury.  Two 2 000-cubic-foot-per-minute negative air machines were being used to  evacuate air from the containment. The floor scraper was a Terminator 2   manufactured by the Innovatech Products and Equipment Company. It was designed  to emit 40 parts per million of carbon monoxide at the tailpipe  but testing  during the inspection showed that it was emitting 10 000 parts per million.  The employer had been performing all maintenance on the Terminator 2 in-house   and he did not use an exhaust gas analyzer when tuning the engines  as  required by the manufacturer.                                                    <extra_id_0>\n",

The vault contained a 12  in. water main and a 4 in. water main that was equipped with a water meter.  The vault had been constructed approximately ten days earlier and had sat  undisturbed until the day of the accident  when the employees were schedulued  to conduct a pressure test of the system. Employee #1  the foreman  went down  into the vault to read the meter. When he did not return  Employee #2  a  laborer  looked down through the manhole cover and saw Employee #1 laying on  the ground. Employee #2 called out to a coworker that Employee #1 was down and  then entered the vault through the manhole and climb down the ladder. The  coworker came over to the manhole and saw Employee #1 on the ground and  Employee #2 hanging upside down  with his leg caught between the ladder rungs.  Neither employee responded to the coworker's calls and he started down the  manhole. The coworker also started down the manhole but noticed an  overpowering musty odor and abruptly stopped and exited. The Fire Department  and paramedics responded to the job site and retrieved Employees #1 and #2   both of whom had died. At the time of rescue the Fire Department's four gas  meters measured the oxygen level in the vault at approximately 9.2 ppm. In its  referral to OSHA  the Fire Department referenced two workers who succumbed to  an IDLH atmosphere.                                                              <extra_id_0>\n",

Context:  On June 20  2006  Employee #1 was installing a large copper gutter with a crew  that began working around 8:30 to 9:30 a.m. The heat index rose to 94 degrees  Fahrenheit by 2:53 p.m. During this time  Employee #1 was reportedly drinking  water steadily. At approximately 10:30 to 11:00 a.m.  he began to complain of  being hot  and then vomited. Around 2:30 to 3:00 p.m.  all crew members were  on ladders  in the sun  on a concrete driveway. At that time  Employee #1's  demeanor and voice changed. At approximately 3:00 p.m.  while descending a  ladder  Employee #1 apparently missed a step  stumbled off the ladder  and  fell onto the garage door. Emergency responders transported him to a hospital.  Upon arrival  he was in cardiopulmonary arrest and his core temperature was  108 degrees Fahrenheit. Employee #1 died at 9:15 p.m. that night. The Medical  Examiner listed the probable cause of death as heat exhaustion/stroke due to  heat exposure.                                                                   <extra_id_0>\n",

      "Input: What type of injury occurred, and can you provide more details about it? Context:  At approximately 3:30 p.m. on October 6  2003  two employees were painting a  galvanized metal roof. They were using half of a 24-foot extension ladder as a  chicken ladder to stand on. One employee was using a roller to paint the roof  with aluminum paint. The owner of the company had climbed down from the roof  to clean rollers while the employee continued painting on the roof. The ladder  section was 13 feet 6 inches long and was being held in place at the peak of  the roof by the slide guides that extend 3 inches about the top of the ladder  rail. The employee stated that he was standing on the chicken ladder which was  not secured at the peak. He also stated that he was not wearing any type of  fall protection while standing on the ladder. He started walking down the  ladder to the eave in order to finish painting when the ladder lifted from the  peak of the roof. He fell approximately 16 feet off of the roof  but struck a  2 foot overhang approximately 6 feet above the concrete patio which broke his  fall. The ladder fell on top of him. Emergency medical services were called  and he was transported to Price Georges Hospital Center. He was later released  and voluntarily went to Saint Mary's Hospital where he was treated and  released. As a result of his fall  he broke both knee caps.                      <extra_id_0>\n",

The property owner  had asked if the demolition company wanted to remove a boiler from another   unused building and keep the scrap metal as payment. The demolition company  had agreed  and the boiler removal was to occur on June 19. Employee #1   working as a laborer  was assigned to assist the supervisor. On the previous  day  June 18  2013  the supervisor and the building owner had walked to the  building where the boiler was located. They had discussed the removal  and  whether the utilities  such as water  gas  and electricity  had been turned  off. The owner indicated they had been turned off. The supervisor did not ask  the owner whether the utility company had turned them off or whether the owner  had directed his own workers to turn them off. Employee #1 and the supervisor  began working on the boiler removal at approximately 7:00 a.m. on June 19.  According to the supervisor's statement during the subsequent investigation   the supervisor first opened valves on the boiler to check whether there was  any pressure  with water or fumes coming out. He then went to the meter  outside and removed one plug to check for pressure in the lines. He did not  notice any pressure or fumes. Then he and Employee #1 proceeded to cut the  pipes. There were approximately 50 pipes that needed to be cut. Employee #1  was using a gas powered chop saw  and the supervisor was using an acetylene  powered cutting torch. They worked all morning. At approximately 1:30 p.m.   Employee #1 cut into a pipe  and a fire ignited. Employee #1 was seriously  burned.

The supervisor did not ask  the owner whether the utility company had turned them off or whether the owner  had directed his own workers to turn them off. Employee #1 and the supervisor  began working on the boiler removal at approximately 7:00 a.m. on June 19.  According to the supervisor's statement during the subsequent investigation   the supervisor first opened valves on the boiler to check whether there was  any pressure  with water or fumes coming out. He then went to the meter  outside and removed one plug to check for pressure in the lines. He did not  notice any pressure or fumes. Then he and Employee #1 proceeded to cut the  pipes. There were approximately 50 pipes that needed to be cut. Employee #1  was using a gas powered chop saw  and the supervisor was using an acetylene  powered cutting torch. They worked all morning. At approximately 1:30 p.m.   Employee #1 cut into a pipe  and a fire ignited. Employee #1 was seriously  burned.

      "Input: What was the event in the report? Context:  At around 10:00 p.m. on November 10  2013  Employee #1  with Villager  Construction Inc.  with a coworker  were using an asphalt milling machine  (Wirtgen; Model Number: W2100) to grind out existing asphalt from an  interstate at a railroad bridge overpass. Employee # 1 was standing on the  ground  checking the depth of the cut into the asphalt  using a handheld  pendant attached to the machine. The pedant could stretch out from ten to 15  ft. This allowed Employee #1 to walk back and forth  checking the cut. The  operator was on the top of the milling machine  controlling the operation of  the machine and ensuring that the milling machine and dump truck (driven by a  second coworker  who worked for an independent trucking service) kept a safe  working distance. A different company  Protective Services Inc. (PSI)  was  responsible for the traffic control of the job site and had shut down the  inside lane of a three lane section of the interstate  so that work could be  conducted on that lane. The entire work zone was approximately two miles long   from start to finish. Employee #1 and the operator of the milling machine had  completed milling four sections (eight total passes) of the inside lane at the  bridge overpasses and were waiting for PSI to shut down the center lane. Dual  lane shut down of the inside and center lanes of the interstate was completed  around 9:30 p.m.  and Employee #1 and the milling machine operator milled two  sections (four total passes) of the center lane. Once both sides of the  overpass were milled out  approximately 200 ft on each side  Employee #1 and  the operator of the milling machine moved the milling machine down the  interstate  approximately1 000 ft  to a railroad overpass and began setting up  to mill the center lane sections. The truck driver backed his truck into  position and remained in the truck to move the truck slowly forward as milling  took place. Employee #1 was positioned between the milling machine and the  concrete median dividers  inside the coned off work zone. The lanes of travel  were approximately 12 ft wide  so the milling machine made two passes  since  it can only cut seven ft wide on each section to cover the entire lane.  Employee #1 was standing approximately three ft in the far inside lane on the  ground between milling machine and interior median wall inside of the approved  traffic control set up  and approximately midway up the machine and 17 ft from  the traffic control devices and flow of traffic. The milling machine was  approximately nine ft wide by 50 ft long  while operating. Employee #1 was  guarded by the machine from the flow of traffic. Approximately five to ten  minutes into the first pass  the milling machine operator noticed lights  hitting the reflectors on the inside wall and turned briefly to see a vehicle  coming. The operator thought it was the Project manager coming to check on the  status of the project. Then  the operator realized that the oncoming vehicle  was not equipped with a strobe  as required in work zones. The operator turned  and yelled for Employee # 1 to run for safety  as a Chevrolet Tahoe came down  the inside lane where Employee #1 was standing. The driver of the Tahoe  continued traveling in the far inside lane of the work zone  where Employee #1  was struck and thrown some 100 ft from where he was originally standing. The  vehicle was moving approximately 45 mph per hour. As he was transferred to a  hospital by emergency personnel  Employee #1 was treated for severe trauma   lacerations  fractures  and contusions to the body and head. Employee #1 was  pronounced dead at the hospital. The driver of the vehicle disregarded the  traffic control set up  all warning lights on the rear of the milling machine   and cone spacing of 100 ft. The construction work zone was set up correctly  with all signage  cone spacing  tapering  attenuators  and lighting; all of  the traffic control set up was approved by MUTCD for this type of tr  <extra_id_0>\n",

Employee #1 was standing approximately three ft in the far inside lane on the  ground between milling machine and interior median wall inside of the approved  traffic control set up  and approximately midway up the machine and 17 ft from  the traffic control devices and flow of traffic. The milling machine was  approximately nine ft wide by 50 ft long  while operating. Employee #1 was  guarded by the machine from the flow of traffic.

      "Input: What type of injury occurred? Context:  At around 10:00 p.m. on November 10  2013  Employee #1  with Villager  Construction Inc.  with a coworker  were using an asphalt milling machine  (Wirtgen; Model Number: W2100) to grind out existing asphalt from an  interstate at a railroad bridge overpass. Employee # 1 was standing on the  ground  checking the depth of the cut into the asphalt  using a handheld  pendant attached to the machine. The pedant could stretch out from ten to 15  ft. This allowed Employee #1 to walk back and forth  checking the cut. The  operator was on the top of the milling machine  controlling the operation of  the machine and ensuring that the milling machine and dump truck (driven by a  second coworker  who worked for an independent trucking service) kept a safe  working distance. A different company  Protective Services Inc. (PSI)  was  responsible for the traffic control of the job site and had shut down the  inside lane of a three lane section of the interstate  so that work could be  conducted on that lane. The entire work zone was approximately two miles long   from start to finish. Employee #1 and the operator of the milling machine had  completed milling four sections (eight total passes) of the inside lane at the  bridge overpasses and were waiting for PSI to shut down the center lane. Dual  lane shut down of the inside and center lanes of the interstate was completed  around 9:30 p.m.  and Employee #1 and the milling machine operator milled two  sections (four total passes) of the center lane. Once both sides of the  overpass were milled out  approximately 200 ft on each side  Employee #1 and  the operator of the milling machine moved the milling machine down the  interstate  approximately1 000 ft  to a railroad overpass and began setting up  to mill the center lane sections. The truck driver backed his truck into  position and remained in the truck to move the truck slowly forward as milling  took place. Employee #1 was positioned between the milling machine and the  concrete median dividers  inside the coned off work zone. The lanes of travel  were approximately 12 ft wide  so the milling machine made two passes  since  it can only cut seven ft wide on each section to cover the entire lane.

They scraped the interiors of the  building and collected debris as they finished up the job. On August 28  2012   at approximately 10:00 a.m  the job assignment was done and every employee was  to put away all the rubble and gather all equipment in order to pack up and  leave the site. When the job assignment was finished  it is typical for all  employees to gather everything and put it away into the garbage bin or in  their trailers and bins. At the time  four coworkers were outside in the  parking lot working near the Number 5 700 Panther. Two coworkers were going to  load the number 5 700 Panther and Employee #1 stated that he was going to load  the number 5 700 Panther on a trailer when their trailer returns from the trip  delivering their first load. This worker got on a Gradall machine to lift a  box bin and move it towards the number 5 700 Panther. The coworkers stated  that Employee #1  not the employee designated to drive the Panther  got on  this vehicle and started driving it. Employee #1 attempted to load a number  5 700 Panther on to a bin. This bin had a rubber lip with a four to five inch  incline ramp on its lip's edge. Employee #1 drove the Panther straight  backwards on the bin and did not go through this four to five inch ramp bump  on to the bin. Right after this unsuccessful attempt  Employee #1 drove it  backwards a second time except this time slightly slanted to his left side.  The left wheel touched the ramp first. On this second attempt  the number  5 700 Panther fell and flipped over. Employee #1 attempted to jump out of this  vehicle but was unable to get away as the Panther which weighed over 2 000  pounds fell on his left foot and pinned it. A coworker got the Gradall  machinery in order to remove the Panther that was on top of Employee #1's left  foot. Employee #1 suffered a serious fracture injury to his left leg and was  hospitalized over twenty-four hours. Employee #1 also stated that he is well  trained in driving other construction vehicle equipment by another foreman.      <extra_id_0>\n",

He was at Birds Eye Foods to service the dock  lock on Bay Number 3. He parked his service truck in front of Bay Number 3. A  tractor-trailer unit was parked in the adjacent bay and there was a gap of  approximately 2 to 3 ft between the trailer and the loading dock frame.  Employee #1 went to the front of the truck to look for the driver. He did not  see the driver so he walked to the back of the trailer and climbed on top of  the dock lock to examine it. The truck driver had been in the sleeper berth. A  dock worker notified the truck driver that he was not fully backed into place  at the loading dock. The driver backed up to close the gap  unaware that  Employee #1 was on the dock lock. Employee #1 fell off the dock lock and was  pinned between the loading dock and trailer.

The company had been working on a stretch of  I-15 from the Utah County line to 12300 South in Salt Lake County.

The barrels  that were located at the south end of the on-ramp had been removed before it  was safe to allow traffic to use the on-ramp. A dump truck had entered the  on-ramp  and the driver of the dump truck did not know that workers were still  removing the barrels from the work site. Employee #1 had removed a barrel from  the interstate and had placed it on the east side of the on-ramp. He was  walking west across the on-ramp to remove another barrel and was struck by the  dump truck. Employee #1 was killed.

After completing the lumber canopy at the west end of the building  the  employees moved to the east end to finish the exterior insulating finishing  system on the spandrel panels at the garden center. While waiting for the  building surface to cool  the employees took a work break. During their break   the weather swiftly changed from clear and sunny to heavy rain and strong  winds. The employees then moved to the north side of the building at the  garden center where they hoped that the masonry piers and spandrel panels  would shelter them from the rain.

Context:  At approximately 3:45 PM on April 18  2007  Employee #1 had accessed a hopper  barge to release a cable that had been used to support the barge on the  starboard side. The barge  a Flexifloat  is a modular system consisting of two  10 ft by 40 ft sections side by side with another 10 ft by 20 ft section  attached at the end. The total size was 20 ft by 50 ft. The hopper section  consisted of 1-in. plate steel. The plates were welded vertically to the deck  and the side plates were welded at an angle with steel I beams for support to  deflect material to the center. The plates were approximately 8 ft high. The  barge was used to catch construction debris from a bridge that was being  demolished. After Employee #1 released the cable  a coworker who was operating  a tug boat  put the boat at notch one in reverse to back the barge out from  under the bridge. After moving approximately 2 ft the barge listed to  starboard approximately 6 to12 inches. It then rolled back to port the same  distance  then back to even keel. It then rolled back to port and capsized  both vessels. As the vessels were rolling to the port side  Employee #1 jumped  into the water and started to swim away.

Context:  At approximately 3:45 PM on April 18  2007  Employee #1 had accessed a hopper  barge to release a cable that had been used to support the barge on the  starboard side. The barge  a Flexifloat  is a modular system consisting of two  10 ft by 40 ft sections side by side with another 10 ft by 20 ft section  attached at the end. The total size was 20 ft by 50 ft. The hopper section  consisted of 1-in. plate steel. The plates were welded vertically to the deck  and the side plates were welded at an angle with steel I beams for support to  deflect material to the center. The plates were approximately 8 ft high. The  barge was used to catch construction debris from a bridge that was being  demolished. After Employee #1 released the cable  a coworker who was operating  a tug boat  put the boat at notch one in reverse to back the barge out from  under the bridge. After moving approximately 2 ft the barge listed to  starboard approximately 6 to12 inches. It then rolled back to port the same  distance  then back to even keel. It then rolled back to port and capsized  both vessels. As the vessels were rolling to the port side  Employee #1 jumped  into the water and started to swim away. The coworker  at almost the same  time  jumped from the pilot house and swam away. As the barge capsized   Employee #1 was caught in the hopper section trapping him under the barge and  he drowned.                                                                      <extra_id_0>\n",

      "Input: When did the incident happen? Context:  On June 8  2008  a transient man was found dead  on the floor  behind the door  to a modified cargo container that was being used as a construction office.  The transient man had been living in a deteriorated nursing home  from which  all residents had been transferred to other facilities. The building was  eventually demolished  and a company that purchased land and built apartment  buildings had started construction at that site. The residential construction  manager had befriended the transient man  and knowing that he had no place to  stay and needed money  the residential manager gave him pocket money to watch  the construction site during off hours. The residential manager gave the  transient man the key to a cargo container  which was modified and used as an  office and storage facility. An electricity-producing gas generator was found  in the cargo container  where the transient man was found dead. A television  set was plugged into an extension cord  which was plugged into the generator.  Both the television and the gas generator were found in the \"on\" position.  There were two small windows that might have provided cross ventilation;  however  there would have been insufficient ventilation for the carbon  monoxide gases produced by the generator. It was not known whether the general  contractor knew that another employer had placed the generator in the cargo  container.

They were inside a 6 000 square foot  containment with 14 foot ceilings  using a propane-powered floor scraper to  remove the two layers of flooring and most of the mastic from the concrete  subfloor. One employee was driving the scraper while others sprayed a wetting  agent and shoveled the flooring into bags. After using the floor-scraping  machine for approximately 3 hours  the employees began to experience nausea  and dizziness. Emergency Services was called and all ten workers were  transported to the hospital for evaluation and treatment. Their highest  blood-gas readings were in the low 20s  but none suffered permanent injury.  Two 2 000-cubic-foot-per-minute negative air machines were being used to  evacuate air from the containment. The floor scraper was a Terminator 2   manufactured by the Innovatech Products and Equipment Company. It was designed  to emit 40 parts per million of carbon monoxide at the tailpipe  but testing  during the inspection showed that it was emitting 10 000 parts per million.  The employer had been performing all maintenance on the Terminator 2 in-house   and he did not use an exhaust gas analyzer when tuning the engines  as  required by the manufacturer.                                                    <extra_id_0>\n",

      "Input: What was the event in the report? Context:  On June 20  2007  Employees #1 and #2 were working in an approximately 7 ft  diameter water vault located about 16 ft underground. The vault contained a 12  in. water main and a 4 in. water main that was equipped with a water meter.  The vault had been constructed approximately ten days earlier and had sat  undisturbed until the day of the accident  when the employees were schedulued  to conduct a pressure test of the system. Employee #1  the foreman  went down  into the vault to read the meter. When he did not return  Employee #2  a  laborer  looked down through the manhole cover and saw Employee #1 laying on  the ground. Employee #2 called out to a coworker that Employee #1 was down and  then entered the vault through the manhole and climb down the ladder. The  coworker came over to the manhole and saw Employee #1 on the ground and  Employee #2 hanging upside down  with his leg caught between the ladder rungs.  Neither employee responded to the coworker's calls and he started down the  manhole. The coworker also started down the manhole but noticed an  overpowering musty odor and abruptly stopped and exited. The Fire Department  and paramedics responded to the job site and retrieved Employees #1 and #2   both of whom had died. At the time of rescue the Fire Department's four gas  meters measured the oxygen level in the vault at approximately 9.2 ppm. In its  referral to OSHA  the Fire Department referenced two workers who succumbed to  an IDLH atmosphere.                                                              <extra_id_0>\n",

Five of the ten workers were at the very top of the tower preparing to do  confined space entry for internal tower work. Three workers were at the ground  level doing structural work. The personal hydrogen sulfide (H2S) meters on  Employee #1 and his coworker started to alarm at the same time. The coworker  called out on his radio  alerting the other workers  including a ground level  supervisor  of the encounter with the H2S. Immediately  all workers on the  tower began to descend from their respective levels. Employee #1 and his  coworker began descending from the 100-ft level and encountered an  increasingly dangerous atmosphere. As those workers at the very top began to  descend  their personal meters began alarming.

Employee #1 and his coworker began  to lose consciousness and fell from their respective locations. Employee #1  fell down to the deck near the 100-ft level. His coworker slid down the ladder  cage that connected the deck near the 100-ft level to the deck below.

Context:  On June 19  2013  Employee #1 and his supervisor  of West Coast & Sons  Demolition  were working at a refinery where the company had been hired to  demolish an old \"greenhouse.\" That demolition had occurred. The property owner  had asked if the demolition company wanted to remove a boiler from another   unused building and keep the scrap metal as payment. The demolition company  had agreed  and the boiler removal was to occur on June 19. Employee #1   working as a laborer  was assigned to assist the supervisor. On the previous  day  June 18  2013  the supervisor and the building owner had walked to the  building where the boiler was located. They had discussed the removal  and  whether the utilities  such as water  gas  and electricity  had been turned  off. The owner indicated they had been turned off. The supervisor did not ask  the owner whether the utility company had turned them off or whether the owner  had directed his own workers to turn them off. Employee #1 and the supervisor  began working on the boiler removal at approximately 7:00 a.m. on June 19.  According to the supervisor's statement during the subsequent investigation   the supervisor first opened valves on the boiler to check whether there was  any pressure  with water or fumes coming out. He then went to the meter  outside and removed one plug to check for pressure in the lines. He did not  notice any pressure or fumes. Then he and Employee #1 proceeded to cut the  pipes. There were approximately 50 pipes that needed to be cut. Employee #1  was using a gas powered chop saw  and the supervisor was using an acetylene  powered cutting torch. They worked all morning. At approximately 1:30 p.m.   Employee #1 cut into a pipe  and a fire ignited. Employee #1 was seriously  burned. His supervisor called emergency services  and the Carpinteria  Summerland Fire Protection District responded. Employee #1 was transported to  Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital  where he was admitted and treated for third  degree burns to his face  arms  and upper torso. He remained hospitalized for  several weeks. The Carpinteria Summerland Fire Protection District reported  this event to Cal/OSHA at 4:54 p.m. on June 19  2013.

      "Input: What caused the incident? Context:  On June 19  2013  Employee #1 and his supervisor  of West Coast & Sons  Demolition  were working at a refinery where the company had been hired to  demolish an old \"greenhouse.\" That demolition had occurred. The property owner  had asked if the demolition company wanted to remove a boiler from another   unused building and keep the scrap metal as payment. The demolition company  had agreed  and the boiler removal was to occur on June 19. Employee #1   working as a laborer  was assigned to assist the supervisor. On the previous  day  June 18  2013  the supervisor and the building owner had walked to the  building where the boiler was located. They had discussed the removal  and  whether the utilities  such as water  gas  and electricity  had been turned  off. The owner indicated they had been turned off. The supervisor did not ask  the owner whether the utility company had turned them off or whether the owner  had directed his own workers to turn them off. Employee #1 and the supervisor  began working on the boiler removal at approximately 7:00 a.m. on June 19.  According to the supervisor's statement during the subsequent investigation   the supervisor first opened valves on the boiler to check whether there was  any pressure  with water or fumes coming out. He then went to the meter  outside and removed one plug to check for pressure in the lines. He did not  notice any pressure or fumes. Then he and Employee #1 proceeded to cut the  pipes. There were approximately 50 pipes that needed to be cut. Employee #1  was using a gas powered chop saw  and the supervisor was using an acetylene  powered cutting torch. They worked all morning. At approximately 1:30 p.m.   Employee #1 cut into a pipe  and a fire ignited. Employee #1 was seriously  burned.

Context:  On December 3  1998  Employee #1 was part of a crew working on a right-of-way  for a new gas line to be installed along a stretch of highway near Moab  UT.  They were using heavy equipment to rough grade the right-of-way in preparation  for the pipeline crew. A coworker operating a Caterpillar D-8 bulldozer struck  a 10 in. diameter gas line with the left cutting edge of his dozer blade   resulting in a high pressure leak and causing a vapor cloud to envelop the  area. The crew managed to escape from the immediate vicinity when  after  several minutes  a semi-truck down the road from the leak ignited the gas and  the pipeline exploded. Employee #1 sustained injuries and was taken to the  emergency room for exploratory surgery because of concerns about internal  damage. His three coworkers were treated for smoke inhalation from the fire  and the explosion  and then released.                                            <extra_id_0>\n",

Context:  On February 24  2003  Employee #1 was operating a Caterpillar Scraper (Model  Number 657-B) to move dirt from one part of the construction site to another.  The scraper was equipped with an open cab with roll-over protection and a seat  belt. There were several similar scrapers operating in the area.

After dumping a load of dirt  Employee #1 was driving the scraper back to the  pickup point when he got hit in the head above his right ear.

Employee #1 was holding the right side of his head and told the employee that  something hit him  but he did not know what it was. The foreman came over  treated Employee #1's wound. Employee #1 drove himself to the Hoag Memorial  Hospital in Newport Beach where he was treated for a depressed fracture in the  skull.

They assumed mistakenly  that Employee #1 had finished  as well. The signal was given to the machine  operator to boom up. The chains started to lift. Employee #1  who was removing  the nut and washer from an eye bolt  sustained a finger amputation when his  finger was caught between the washer and the concrete box. He was transported  to the hospital  where he was treated for the amputation and released without  hospitalization.                                                                 <extra_id_0>\n",

Context:  This employer was contracted to build a new 1.7-million gallon water tank to  replace an existing 1 million gallon tank located at the same site. A crew of  employees was working with a 210-ton Grove crane that was utilizing both hook  blocks on the crane. A piece of pre-cast panel was lifted utilizing both the  main and auxiliary hook blocks. The panel was secured in the vertical position  utilizing the auxiliary hook block of the crane. The main hook block of the  crane had no load it at the time  but had become bound up on a piece of  2-in.-by-6-in. wood at the top back side of the pre-cast panel. The top was  approximately 79 ft above the ground. The site superintendent told three  employees to go up in the articulating boom lift to where the block was bound  and free it up. One of the employees grabbed the block itself while the other  two grabbed the 0.875-in. wire rope supporting the 2127-pound block. Without  warning any of the employees on the lift  the superintendent signaled the  crane operator to move the crane block.

A temporary control unit (with an attached  50-ft cable) was hanging from a 6-ft step ladder in the car. According to the  coworker  when the car was between the first and second levels of the building  structure  it suddenly began to move in an upward direction. The coworker  stated that he tried to stop the elevator by depressing the stop button on the  temporary control unit. However  the elevator continued to move. When it  reached the second level  the coworker exited the elevator car  and ran down a  stairway to the first level to shut off the main power disconnect in a control  room adjacent to the elevator hoistway. The coworker then found Employee #1  dead in the hoistway pit  lying in a prone position.                             <extra_id_0>\n",

      "Input: What was the event in the report? Context:  At 8:30 a.m. on July 26  2012  Employee #1 was working for a general  contractor with over fifty years of experience in construction. The employer  was engaged in design  build  and construction management services. It  specialized in commercial  agricultural  industrial  and residential  construction. Employee #1 had joined the company on July 2  2012. He attended  once a week safety meetings conducted at the job site. He did not receive  specific safety training on the subject of assisting during the loading of  material. Employee #1 and a coworker had been assigned by a foreman to pick up  17 sheets of particle board in a storage yard. The coworker was operating a  JLG Model Number 10054 Skytrak aerial lift  with Serial Number 0160044376  to  pick up the particle board. First  the coworker used one fork to push the top  17 particle boards off the rest of the stack. Then he used one fork to lift  the corner of these particle boards. Employee #1 was asked to put a 2-inch by  4-inch by 20-inch (50-millimeter by 100-millimeter by 0.51-meter) piece of  scrap lumber underneath the top 17 sheets at the center of the particle  boards.
